Plaid Trust Layer for Agentic Finance
A PM Portfolio Project

Thesis: AI agents performing financial tasks need a trust layer that can:
1. Verify the agent is legitimately delegated by the user
2. Score the risk of agent-initiated transactions in real-time
3. Distinguish legitimate agent behavior from fraud patterns

This prototype demonstrates how Plaid's existing assets (Identity, Beacon, Transfer)
could be packaged into an agent-facing API.
